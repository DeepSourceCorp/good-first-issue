Welcome! üëãüèº

**Good First Issue** is an initiaitive to curate easy pickings from popular projects, so developers who've never made a contribution to open-source can get started easily.

Open-source maintainers are always looking to get more people involved, but new developers generally think it's difficult to become a contributor. We believe getting developers to fix super-easy issues removes the barrier for future contributions. This is why Good First Issue exists.

## Adding a new project

You're welcome to add a new project in Good First Issue, and we encourage all projects &mdash; old and new, big and small.

Follow these simple steps:

- Our goal is to narrow down projects for new open-source contributors. To maintain the quality of projects in Good First Issue, please make sure your GitHub repository meets the following criteria:

  - At least three issue with the `good first issue` label. This label is already present on all repositories by default. If not, you can follow the steps [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/applying-labels-to-issues-and-pull-requests).

  - Detailed setup instructions for the project.

  - CONTRIBUTING.md

  - Actively maintained.

- Add your repository's path in [data/repositories.toml](data/repositories.toml).

- Create a new pull-request. Please add the link to the issues page of the repository in the PR description. Once the pull-request is merged, the changes will be live on [goodfirstissue.dev](https://goodfirstissue.dev/).
