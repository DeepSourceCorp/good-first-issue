👋 Welcome!

Good First Issue is a community-driven initiative that helps developers take their first step into open source.

Many developers want to contribute to open source but feel overwhelmed or unsure where to begin. Maintainers, on the other hand, are always looking for new contributors.
We bridge this gap by curating beginner-friendly issues from popular open-source projects—so getting started feels simple, not scary.

Fixing small, approachable issues builds confidence and opens the door to bigger contributions. That’s exactly why Good First Issue exists 🚀
