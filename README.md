Welcome! üëãüèº

**Good First Issue** is an initiaitive to curate easy pickings from popular projects, so developers who've never made a contribution to open-source can get started easily.

### New to Open Source? Good First Issue has you covered!
Open-source maintainers are always looking to get more people involved, but new developers generally think it's difficult to become a contributor. We believe getting developers to fix super-easy issues removes the barrier for future contributions. This is why Good First Issue exists.

## Adding a new project

You're welcome to add a new project in Good First Issue, and we encourage all projects &mdash; old and new, big and small.

Follow these simple steps:

* Make sure your GitHub repository has at least one issue with the `good first issue` label. This label is already present on all repositories by default. If not, you can follow the steps [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/applying-labels-to-issues-and-pull-requests).

* Add your repository's path in [data/repositories.toml](data/repositories.toml).

* Create a new pull-request. Once the pull-request is merged, the changes will be live on [goodfirstissue.dev](https://goodfirstissue.dev/).
