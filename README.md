Welcome! 👋🏼

**Good First Issue** is an initiative to curate easy pickings from popular projects, so developers who've never contributed to open-source can get started quickly.

Open-source maintainers are always looking to get more people involved, but new developers generally think it's challenging to become a contributor. We believe getting developers to fix super-easy issues removes the barrier for future contributions. This is why Good First Issue exists.
