Welcome! 👋🏼

"Good First Issue" is an initiative to curate easy-to-address tasks from popular projects, so developers who have never contributed to open-source can get started quickly.

While open-source maintainers constantly look for new contributors, many developers find the process intimidating. We believe that encouraging developers to fix 'super-easy' issues removes this barrier, which is why Good First Issue exists.
